                <p class="text-small">Saath Saath Foundation (SSF), was founded in 2021, by Mona Almeida, 
                    Usha Donolikar & Razia Pathan with a mission to align volunteers who have the willingness 
                    to offer service and the Institutions who are in need of the service. Service can be in any 
                    form and for any period - intent, compassion and willingness to serve is the only prerequisite to
                     become a Volunteer. SSF aspires to grow into becoming a movement of volunteerism, a movement that will 
                     create a life-long impact on both the volunteers and NGO they serve.

            development field for over 10 years. She has not only been a trustee of an NGO ( that supports trafficking 
            survivors and women in distress) for over 8 years but also comes with corporate and entrepreneurial experience. 
            With her leadership skills and excellent communication skills, Mona has led teams of dedicated professionals

                She has herself been a volunteer and contributed over the last 6 years to the community. Her compassion
                 and dedication can be observed in her day to day working. Not only is she great at relationship management, 
                 accounting and administration, she has a close connection at the grassroot level. Persistent and hard working,
                  Usha has supported and brought remarkable results to individual beneficiaries when the challenges were high and 
                  hope was low.

                <p class="paras-work">Working from the ground up, Razia Pathan is an inspiration. She has worked 
                    hard and achieved so much both professionally and personally despite her challenges. With her zeal and 
                    enthusiasm to make a difference, she has invested her life to work for the community. She has a plethora
                     of experience (over 15 years) working at the grass-root levels with multiple not-for-profit organizations
                      in the area of rehabilitation, children welfare  and women empowerment. She envisions SSF to start a journey 
                      that brings lots of prosperity to the people working with SSF as well as the people SSF is working for.
