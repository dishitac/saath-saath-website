    <p class="paras-work"> We are proud to share our journey of making a positive impact in some of the most remote and underserved 
        areas around Mumbai and Thane. Our primary focus lies in the adivasi regions of Dhamni, Chaudharwadi, Mograz, and Pinglas
        in Karjat. These are truly off-the-grid locations, situated 25 kilometers deep within the interiors. To give you a glimpse
        of the challenges these communities face, there's barely one bus service connecting them to the station, 
        and even that is often unreliable. Moreover, access to basic amenities like tap water is a luxury these households cannot afford. </p>

    <p class="paras-work"> In these far-flung regions, we have been collaborating with Zilla Parishad schools and Ashram Shala schools, which
        are managed by the Adivasi Board. Our aim is to bring about meaningful change and provide opportunities for growth. </p>

    
    <p class="paras-work"> One noteworthy initiative has been in the community of Ambivali, where we are creating livelihood opportunities. The 
        community here, while slightly better off, faces a unique challenge. Young girls have received some level of education,
        but they are hesitant to engage in menial labor, and their parents are reluctant to send them further away from 
        home for work. However, all these girls share a common interest in stitching, with some possessing basic skills and 
        others eager to learn. </p>

            
    <p class="paras-work"> To address this, we have a dedicated lady ready to impart her knowledge in stitching, and we have secured a 
        suitable space for training. What's truly groundbreaking is our partnership with a fashion house from 
        Bangalore, which has pledged to supply us with excess cloth for training purposes. With the acquisition of 
        four sewing machines, we can equip two of them for the benefit of this community, while the other two can be 
        utilized for the Ashram Shala school. This will enable us to kickstart skill training programs for the young girls, a 
        request that came directly from the school's Principal and warden.</p>

    <p class="paras-work"> It's important to note that we are the only nonprofit organization operating in these remote areas, making our work 
    all the more vital and impactful. Together, we are bridging gaps and creating opportunities where they are needed 
    most. Join us in our mission to bring hope and change to these deserving communities.</p>
        
    <p class="paras-work"> 
        We work at 3 levels:
            <li class="paras-work">Health & Nutrition: Supporting pregnant/lactating mothers and malnourished children.</li>
            <li class="paras-work">Education: Aiding Zilla Parishad and Ashram Shala schools with resources and support. </li>
            <li class="paras-work">Skill Development: Training young women to craft bags for livelihood opportunities. </li>
