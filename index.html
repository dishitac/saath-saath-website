        <p class="paras-work">Saath Saath foundation is a registered non profit with all certifications like 80g and 12AA in place. </p>
        <p class="paras-work">We have been working in and around Mumbai and Thane but mainly focusing in the adivasi villages of karjat, 
            namely Chaudharwadi,  Mograz, Ambivali, Pinglas and Dhamni. These are remote location, 25 kms in the interiors with barely one bus service 
            to connect them to the station (which often gets cancelled!) and no tap connection in the houses.</p>
        <p class="paras-work">Our work in these areas is three pronged.</p>
        <p class="paras-work">
            <li class="paras-work">
                Education : Here, we are a working in conjunction with Zilla parishad schools and Ashram shala school, run by the adivasi board. 
                We have appointed a support teacher as requested by the school and also handed over computers for their use, conducted sessions
                 on good touch, bad touch. A lot more needs to be done, nevertheless!
            </li> 
            <li class="paras-work">
                We are working in the community, for livelihood opportunities . Training young girls to stitch bags. We do need support here for paying 
                salary to the tailoring teachers as also to help us sell the bags which the girls make. 
            </li>
            <li class="paras-work">
                Nutrition : We are also working in coordination with the local public health center and hope to make a difference as far as malnutrition 
                is concerned, especially amongst the expecting mothers and the lactating ones too.This work is in coordination with the local Public Health Centre.
            </li>
        </p>
        <p class="paras-work">
            The inhabitants of Mograz are adivasi Agiwlay, kolis. Kolis are at the bottom of the ladder in adivasis too. A large number donâ€™t even have a Aadhar card 
            and so are deprived of whatever benefits are due to them by the local administration. Most men are not inclined to regular employment. The ladies take care of
             the house and children, daily walk miles to wash clothes and are grossly underweight . Their weight is 30kg to 35 kg on an average. A large number of children are 
             underweight and malnourished. They are first generation school goers. The first meal of the day is usually the midday meal at school that they get.
        </p>
        <p class="paras-work">
            Suffice to say, there is a plethora of needs here, the list is endless. The school, for eg, has a laboratory but no equipments inside. So even the science stream of 
            students in 12 standard have not seen any apparatus. 
        </p>
        <p class="paras-work">
            I must add, no other non profit is working in this area.

                <p class="paras-work">At Saath Saath, we believe in harnessing the power of 
                    those who have, whether it's knowledge, skills, resources, or wisdom, to uplift those who aspire to have more. 
                    We are driven by a deep-rooted belief that altruism resides within us all, motivating us to help and share our 
                    knowledge with others. </p>

                    <p class="paras-work"> In a world brimming with untapped potential, we recognize the need for a conduit, 
                        and that's where Saath Saath comes in. Our mission is to facilitate a transformation, making volunteering a 
                        seamless and integral part of everyday life. </p>
                    
                        <p class="paras-work"> We understand that misconceptions surround volunteering and the social sector.
                             Some may fear that it's solely about poverty, sorrow, and disease. We're here to change that perception. 
                             For us, it's about the joy of giving and receiving. It's a dynamic exchange where everyone benefits. </p>
                    
                             <p class="paras-work">Join us in shaping a world where giving back is not an occasional act but a way of life. Discover the true essence 
                    of volunteering and the social sector with Saath Saath. Together, let's bridge the gap and create a world where knowledge,
